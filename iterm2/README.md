# Mac OS X iTerm2 Settings
(from fnichol/macosx-iterm2-settings)

## Installation
You can run the included bash script to install or update your preferences.
Note that iTerm.app could overwrite your preferences when it exits so there
are some checks to make sure it's doing it's work cleanly.

Need iTerm.app? Simple:

```sh
brew cask install iterm2
```

Now install the settings:

```sh
install-settings.sh
```
